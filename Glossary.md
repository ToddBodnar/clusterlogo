Assignment - One repetition of one combination of desired variables given to one client. "The Client's current _assignment_ is to run the simulation with a gravity of 3.7 m/s and a surface pressure of 600 PA"

Client - The program that receives assignments and executes them. "This _client_ has completed 54 assignments so far."

Experiment - The sum of all related assignments. "This _experiment_ will vary vision ranges and food consumption of turtles."

IP Address - The location of a computer on the internet that is needed for other computers to connect to it. Similar to a phone number. "Tell the clients to connect to the _IP address_ of 123.321.123.321."

NetLogo - An agent based modeling system available at http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. "We used _NetNogo_ to simulate social situations."

.nLogo - A file containing programming for a NetLogo application. "Use this _.nLogo_ to generate Fibonacci numbers."

Server - The program that generates assignments, sends them to clients, and receives generated data. "The _server_ is sending three experiments worth of assignments to ten clients."

Step - Similar to a Tick, in each step the command "go" is called exactly once. "The simulation runs for 10,000 _steps_."
