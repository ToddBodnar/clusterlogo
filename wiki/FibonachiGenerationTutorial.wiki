#summary Based off of FibGen.nlogo developed for program testing

This tutorial assumes previous knowledge of using NetLogo. Please view the [http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/NetLogo%20User%20Manual.pdf NetLogo User Manual] if you are not familiar with NetLogo.

In this tutorial, we are going to develop a simple NetLogo program and configure Cluster Logo to run the experiment on several computers. Our program will get a number, n, from the user via an input box, and calculate the nth Fibonacci number. The number will be calculated by the recursive formula:

f(x) = 
|| 1 || x < 2||
|| f(x-1) + f(x-2) || otherwise ||

This algorithm runs at O(n!) which is extremely slow for large numbers ( roughly n > 20 ). While this would be unwanted for an actual program, it is fine for our purposes because it allows long execution times, like that of actual programs. 

The complete code is posted below. We also added a go and setup button for testing purposes, but they are not needed as long as setup and go routines are developed. The program outputs the results to data.dat, as explained in [http://code.google.com/p/clusterlogo/wiki/MakingCompatiblePrograms Making Compatible Programs].

{{{
to setup
end
    
to go
  file-open "data.dat"
  file-type number
  file-type ","
  file-print fib number
  file-close
end

to-report fib [num]
  if num < 2 [
      report num
  ]
      
  report fib (num - 1) + fib (num - 2)
end 
}}}
