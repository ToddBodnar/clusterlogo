Cluster Logo's version uses three numbers. For example, the current release is 0.4.1 for both the Server and Client.

The first number is incremented for major rewrites. The program is currently in beta. All implemented features _should_ be working, but additional features are not developed. Expect each of the pre-1.0.0 releases to be fairly different from each other.

The second number is changed each time a program is released that is **No longer compatible** with previous Clients/Servers. Expect new features or other major modifications each time a new one is released.

The third number indicates small changes to correct bugs, typos, etc. Each of these releases should be completely compatible with other releases with the same first and second number. This is useful because a user could update the server from 0.4.0 to 0.4.1 with out having to preform any updating of the client. Because these changes are small and often specific to either the client or the server, the current releases may not match in the last digit.
